# CFB Mismatch Model - Build Summary

## Overview

This repository now contains a complete, functional Python package for computing weekly position-group mismatch scores for college football games. The implementation follows the specifications outlined in the README.md.

## What Has Been Built

### 1. Package Structure ✅

```

├── configs/              # YAML configuration files
├── data/                 # Data directories for input/output
├── src/cfb_mismatch/    # Main Python package
│   ├── adapters/        # Data source adapters
│   └── [core modules]   # CLI, main logic, features
├── examples/            # Example scripts and sample data
└── [setup files]        # setup.py, pyproject.toml, etc.
```

### 2. Core Functionality ✅

- **CLI Tool**: `cfb-mismatch` command installed and working
- **CFBD Integration**: Fetches team metrics from CollegeFootballData API
- **Configuration System**: YAML-based settings and weights
- **Data Adapters**: PFF and FantasyPoints CSV loaders
- **Extended Features**: Framework for computing advanced metrics
- **Output Generation**: Creates multiple CSV files with mismatch scores

### 3. Key Features Implemented

#### Command-Line Interface (cli.py)
- `cfb-mismatch week` command
- Year and week parameters
- Custom output directory option
- API key validation

#### Core Pipeline (main.py)
- Configuration loading from YAML
- CFBD API client setup
- Team statistics fetching
- Base mismatch computation
- Output file generation

#### Extended Features (ext_features.py)
- PFF feature integration
- FantasyPoints feature integration
- Composite scoring framework

#### Data Adapters
- **PFF Adapter** (adapters/pff.py):
  - OL/DL win rate loading
  - Defensive front/coverage data
  - Run concept metrics
  
- **FantasyPoints Adapter** (adapters/fantasypoints.py):
  - Receiver splits loading
  - Team-level aggregation
  - Man/zone coverage metrics

### 4. Configuration Files ✅

#### configs/settings.yaml
- Feature toggles (use_pff, use_fantasypoints)
- CFBD API configuration
- File path settings
- Output configuration
- Processing parameters

#### configs/weights.yaml
- Base metric weights (EPA, success rate, explosiveness, etc.)
- PFF feature weights
- FantasyPoints feature weights
- Composite score weights

### 5. Documentation ✅

- **README.md**: Original project description (preserved)
- **LICENSE**: MIT License
- **DEVELOPMENT.md**: Developer guide with setup instructions
- **examples/README.md**: Guide to example scripts and sample data
- **data/external/README.md**: External data directory guide
- **data/out/README.md**: Output directory guide

### 6. Examples and Testing ✅

- **test_integration.py**: Integration test suite
- **examples/basic_usage.py**: Usage examples
- **Sample CSV files**: Templates for PFF and FantasyPoints data

## Installation Verification

The package has been successfully:
1. ✅ Installed with `pip install -e .`
2. ✅ Tested with `cfb-mismatch --help`
3. ✅ Verified all imports work correctly
4. ✅ Tested configuration loading
5. ✅ Tested data adapters with sample files
6. ✅ Run integration tests successfully

## How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install
pip install -e .

# Set API key
export CFBD_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Run for a specific week
cfb-mismatch week --year 2025 --week 7

# Output will be in data/out/
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from cfb_mismatch.main import build_week

build_week(year=2025, week=7, output_dir="reports/week7")
```

### With PFF/FantasyPoints Data
1. Place CSV files in `data/external/`
2. Update `configs/settings.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   use_pff: true
   use_fantasypoints: true
   ```
3. Run normally

## Architecture Highlights

### Modular Design
- Clear separation between CLI, core logic, and data adapters
- Configurable weights without code changes
- Graceful fallback when optional data is missing

### Extensibility
- Easy to add new metrics in weights.yaml
- New data sources can be added as adapters
- Extended features can be computed independently

### Best Practices
- Type hints for better code documentation
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Configuration-driven behavior

## Dependencies

- **Python 3.9+** (tested with 3.12)
- **cfbd**: College Football Data API client
- **pandas**: Data manipulation
- **pyyaml**: Configuration files
- **requests**: HTTP requests

All dependencies install automatically with the package.

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Package imports work
- ✅ CLI commands respond correctly
- ✅ Configuration files load properly
- ✅ PFF adapter handles sample data
- ✅ FantasyPoints adapter works correctly
- ✅ API key validation functions as expected

## Future Enhancements

The codebase is designed to support:
- Additional data sources
- New mismatch metrics
- Historical data analysis
- Weight calibration tools
- Visualization capabilities

## Compliance with README Specifications

✅ Python 3.9+ support
✅ CFBD API integration
✅ Optional PFF data support
✅ Optional FantasyPoints data support
✅ Configurable weights via YAML
✅ CLI with year/week parameters
✅ Multiple CSV outputs
✅ Custom output directory option
✅ Graceful fallback for missing data
✅ MIT License
✅ Documented column names in adapters

## Summary

The CFB Mismatch Model is now a fully functional Python package that matches all specifications in the README. It can be installed, configured, and used to compute position-group mismatch scores for college football games using data from CFBD and optional PFF/FantasyPoints sources.
