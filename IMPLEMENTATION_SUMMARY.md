# Integration Implementation Summary

## Question Answered

**"So is this integrating my files and the cfbd api?"**

**Answer: YES!** This repository now fully integrates your player-level stats files with CFBD API data.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. CFBD Data Adapter (`src/cfb_mismatch/adapters/cfbd_data.py`)

A Python module that:
- Loads CFBD games data (CSV or Parquet format)
- Loads CFBD team information
- Aggregates game-level data to team-level statistics
- Merges CFBD data with user stats by team name

Functions:
- `load_cfbd_games()` - Load game data for a season
- `load_cfbd_team_info()` - Load team reference data
- `aggregate_team_games()` - Calculate wins, scoring averages, etc.
- `merge_with_user_stats()` - Merge datasets by team name

### 2. Integration Functions (`src/cfb_mismatch/main.py`)

Added:
- `load_cfbd_data()` - Wrapper to load and aggregate CFBD data
- `generate_integrated_report()` - Create combined report from both sources

These functions seamlessly combine:
- Your player-level stats (coverage grades, receiving efficiency)
- CFBD game data (win/loss, scoring, team performance)

### 3. Enhanced CLI (`src/cfb_mismatch/cli.py`)

New command-line options:
```bash
cfb-mismatch analyze [--season YEAR] [--season-type regular|postseason]
```

- `--season`: Enables CFBD integration for specified year
- `--season-type`: Regular season or postseason (default: regular)

### 4. Configuration Update (`configs/settings.yaml`)

Added CFBD data paths:
```yaml
cfbd_paths:
  data_dir: "data/cfbd"
```

### 5. Comprehensive Documentation

**New Files:**
1. **FAQ.md** - Directly answers integration questions
2. **DATA_INTEGRATION.md** - Architecture and data flow details
3. **INTEGRATION_EXAMPLES.md** - Usage examples and Python API

**Updated Files:**
- README.md - Integration workflow and documentation links
- USAGE.md - Command-line examples with CFBD integration

## How to Use

### Option 1: User Stats Only

```bash
cfb-mismatch analyze
```

Output:
- Team-level aggregations from your CSV files
- Defense coverage stats
- Receiving concept and scheme metrics
- Summary report with key metrics

### Option 2: Integrated Analysis (Both Sources)

```bash
# 1. Fetch CFBD data
export CFBD_API_KEY="your-key"
Rscript scripts/fetch_cfb_data.R --season 2024 --season_type regular

# 2. Run integrated analysis
cfb-mismatch analyze --season 2024
```

Output:
- Everything from Option 1
- PLUS: Win/loss records, win percentage, scoring averages, point differential
- Merged by team name in integrated summary

   (Player Stats + Game Results)
```

## Integrated Output Columns

### From Your Stats:
- `man_coverage_grade` - Defensive man coverage grade
- `zone_coverage_grade` - Defensive zone coverage grade
- `man_qb_rating_against` - QB rating allowed vs man
- `zone_qb_rating_against` - QB rating allowed vs zone
- `screen_yprr` - Yards per route run on screens
- `slot_yprr` - Yards per route run in slot
- `man_yprr` - Receiving YPRR vs man coverage
- `zone_yprr` - Receiving YPRR vs zone coverage

### From CFBD API:
- `games_played` - Number of games
- `wins` - Number of wins
- `win_pct` - Win percentage
- `avg_points_scored` - Points per game
- `avg_points_allowed` - Points allowed per game
- `point_differential` - Average margin

## Testing

All integration functionality has been tested:
- Module imports
- Configuration loading
- User stats loading
- CFBD data loading
- Team stats computation
- Report generation (with and without CFBD)
- Integrated report with merged data

Test results: ✓ All tests passed

## Key Features

1. **Flexible**: Use either data source independently or together
2. **Automatic**: Team name normalization for matching
3. **Graceful**: Missing CFBD data doesn't break user stats analysis
4. **Documented**: Comprehensive guides for all use cases
5. **Tested**: Verified with integration test suite

## Example Output

When running with integration:
```
Loading stats files...
✓ Loaded 3530 defensive player records
✓ Loaded 2072 receiving concept records
✓ Loaded 2072 receiving scheme records

Loading CFBD data for season 2024...
✓ Loaded 10 CFBD games for 2024 regular season
✓ Loaded CFBD team info for 20 teams
✓ Aggregated CFBD stats for 20 teams

Generating summary report...
✓ Integrated CFBD data for 136 teams
✓ Generated integrated report with CFBD data

--- Top 5 Teams by Win Percentage ---
 team_name  win_pct  wins  games_played
   ALABAMA      1.0   1.0           1.0
   GEORGIA      1.0   1.0           1.0
```
