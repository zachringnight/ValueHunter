# CFBD Direct API Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the integration with the CFBD API using direct HTTP requests to https://api.collegefootballdata.com/ to replace the R-based CFBD data fetching workflow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Updated
- **requirements.txt**: Uses `requests>=2.28.0` for HTTP requests
- **setup.py**: Uses `requests>=2.28.0` as dependency
- Removed the `cfbd` Python package wrapper in favor of direct API calls

### 2. Python Script Implementation
- **scripts/fetch_cfb_data.py**: Standalone Python script that:
  - Makes direct HTTP GET requests to https://api.collegefootballdata.com/games
  - Makes direct HTTP GET requests to https://api.collegefootballdata.com/teams
  - Uses Bearer token authentication with CFBD_API_KEY
  - Saves data in both CSV and Parquet formats
  - Provides identical functionality to the previous implementations

### 3. Enhanced Adapter Module
- **src/cfb_mismatch/adapters/cfbd_data.py**: Updated functions:
  - `fetch_cfbd_games_from_api()`: Fetch games directly from API using requests
  - `fetch_cfbd_team_info_from_api()`: Fetch team info directly from API using requests
  - `fetch_and_save_cfbd_data()`: Fetch and save data in one operation
  - Updated `load_and_aggregate_cfbd_data()` to support `fetch_from_api` parameter
  - All functions use direct HTTP requests via the `requests` library

### 4. CLI Enhancements
- **src/cfb_mismatch/cli.py**: Added new features:
  - New command: `cfb-mismatch fetch-cfbd` for fetching data from API
  - Updated `analyze` command with `--fetch-cfbd` flag
  - Support for fetching data during analysis without pre-fetching

### 5. Main Module Updates
- **src/cfb_mismatch/main.py**: Updated:
  - `load_cfbd_data()` now supports `fetch_from_api` and `api_key` parameters
  - Maintains backward compatibility with file-based loading

### 6. GitHub Actions Workflow
- **.github/workflows/cfb-data-fetch.yml**: Updated to:
  - Use Python with requests library
  - Install Python dependencies (pandas, pyarrow, pyyaml, requests)
  - Run the Python fetch script
  - Renamed from "Fetch CFB data (Python cfbd package)" to "Fetch CFB data (Direct API)"

### 7. Documentation Updates
- **DATA_INTEGRATION.md**: Updated to reflect:
  - Python-based fetching using cfbd package
  - New CLI commands and workflow
  - Updated data flow diagram
  
- **README.md**: Updated to show:
  - Python-based data fetching commands
  - New CLI usage examples
  - Removed R-specific instructions

## Usage Examples

### Fetch Data Using CLI
```bash
# Set API key
export CFBD_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Fetch using CLI command
cfb-mismatch fetch-cfbd --season 2024 --season-type regular
```

### Fetch Data Using Standalone Script
```bash
python scripts/fetch_cfb_data.py --season 2024 --season_type regular
```

### Analyze with Live API Fetching
```bash
cfb-mismatch analyze --season 2024 --fetch-cfbd
```

### Analyze with Pre-fetched Data
```bash
# First fetch
cfb-mismatch fetch-cfbd --season 2024 --season-type regular

# Then analyze
cfb-mismatch analyze --season 2024
```

## Backward Compatibility

The integration maintains full backward compatibility:
- File-based loading still works (default behavior)
- If cfbd package is not installed, functions gracefully return None
- Existing workflows continue to function
- R script remains in repository for reference

## Benefits of Direct API Integration

1. **No additional SDK dependency**: Uses standard `requests` library
2. **Unified language**: Everything is now in Python
3. **Better control**: Direct access to API responses
4. **Easier debugging**: Simple HTTP requests are easier to troubleshoot
5. **Lightweight**: Fewer dependencies to manage
6. **Direct to source**: Makes requests directly to https://api.collegefootballdata.com/

## Testing

All functionality has been tested and verified:
- ✓ CLI commands work correctly
- ✓ Import checks pass
- ✓ Function signatures are correct
- ✓ File loading works
- ✓ API functions make direct HTTP requests
- ✓ Uses requests library instead of cfbd package

## Migration Notes

For users migrating from R-based workflow:
1. Install the requests package: `pip install requests`
2. Set CFBD_API_KEY environment variable (same as before)
3. Use new Python commands instead of Rscript
4. Output format and file locations remain the same
5. API calls are made directly to https://api.collegefootballdata.com/
