# CFBD Python Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the integration of the `cfbd` Python package to replace the R-based CFBD data fetching workflow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
- **requirements.txt**: Added `cfbd>=5.0.0`
- **setup.py**: Added `cfbd>=5.0.0` to install_requires

### 2. New Python Script
- **scripts/fetch_cfb_data.py**: New standalone Python script that:
  - Fetches game data using `cfbd.GamesApi`
  - Fetches team information using `cfbd.TeamsApi`
  - Saves data in both CSV and Parquet formats
  - Mirrors the functionality of the previous R script

### 3. Enhanced Adapter Module
- **src/cfb_mismatch/adapters/cfbd_data.py**: Added new functions:
  - `fetch_cfbd_games_from_api()`: Fetch games directly from API
  - `fetch_cfbd_team_info_from_api()`: Fetch team info directly from API
  - `fetch_and_save_cfbd_data()`: Fetch and save data in one operation
  - Updated `load_and_aggregate_cfbd_data()` to support `fetch_from_api` parameter
  - Graceful fallback when cfbd package is not available

### 4. CLI Enhancements
- **src/cfb_mismatch/cli.py**: Added new features:
  - New command: `cfb-mismatch fetch-cfbd` for fetching data from API
  - Updated `analyze` command with `--fetch-cfbd` flag
  - Support for fetching data during analysis without pre-fetching

### 5. Main Module Updates
- **src/cfb_mismatch/main.py**: Updated:
  - `load_cfbd_data()` now supports `fetch_from_api` and `api_key` parameters
  - Maintains backward compatibility with file-based loading

### 6. GitHub Actions Workflow
- **.github/workflows/cfb-data-fetch.yml**: Updated to:
  - Use Python instead of R
  - Install Python dependencies (pandas, pyarrow, pyyaml, cfbd)
  - Run the new Python fetch script
  - Renamed from "Fetch CFB data (cfbfastR)" to "Fetch CFB data (Python cfbd package)"

### 7. Documentation Updates
- **DATA_INTEGRATION.md**: Updated to reflect:
  - Python-based fetching using cfbd package
  - New CLI commands and workflow
  - Updated data flow diagram
  
- **README.md**: Updated to show:
  - Python-based data fetching commands
  - New CLI usage examples
  - Removed R-specific instructions

## Usage Examples

### Fetch Data Using CLI
```bash
# Set API key
export CFBD_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Fetch using CLI command
cfb-mismatch fetch-cfbd --season 2024 --season-type regular
```

### Fetch Data Using Standalone Script
```bash
python scripts/fetch_cfb_data.py --season 2024 --season_type regular
```

### Analyze with Live API Fetching
```bash
cfb-mismatch analyze --season 2024 --fetch-cfbd
```

### Analyze with Pre-fetched Data
```bash
# First fetch
cfb-mismatch fetch-cfbd --season 2024 --season-type regular

# Then analyze
cfb-mismatch analyze --season 2024
```

## Backward Compatibility

The integration maintains full backward compatibility:
- File-based loading still works (default behavior)
- If cfbd package is not installed, functions gracefully return None
- Existing workflows continue to function
- R script remains in repository for reference

## Benefits of Python Integration

1. **No R dependency**: Eliminates need for R runtime and packages
2. **Unified language**: Everything is now in Python
3. **Better IDE support**: Python tooling is more widely supported
4. **Direct API access**: Can fetch data programmatically without external scripts
5. **Easier integration**: Can fetch data inline during analysis
6. **Official SDK**: Uses the official CFBD Python package

## Testing

All functionality has been tested and verified:
- ✓ CLI commands work correctly
- ✓ Import checks pass
- ✓ Function signatures are correct
- ✓ File loading works
- ✓ API functions are available
- ✓ Graceful fallback when cfbd not installed

## Migration Notes

For users migrating from R-based workflow:
1. Install the cfbd package: `pip install cfbd`
2. Set CFBD_API_KEY environment variable (same as before)
3. Use new Python commands instead of Rscript
4. Output format and file locations remain the same
